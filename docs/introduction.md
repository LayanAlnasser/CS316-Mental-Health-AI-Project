# Introduction

Mental health conditions such as **depression** and **anxiety** are widespread, yet frequently under-reported or detected only after symptoms become severe. Individuals often express emotional states, stress, and psychological distress through **written language**, including journals, surveys, and online narratives. This creates an opportunity for **AI-assisted text analysis** to support early awareness and longitudinal mental health monitoring.

Recent advances in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning enable automated analysis of large volumes of textual data, making scalable mental health screening increasingly feasible. However, most existing approaches rely on **static, cross-sectional analysis**, which fails to capture gradual changes or emerging patterns over time—particularly within **Arabic-language contexts**, which remain underrepresented in mental health NLP research.

This project explores whether **embedding-based NLP classifiers** can effectively identify anxiety and depression severity levels from Arabic text and support **longitudinal risk monitoring** through predictive alert mechanisms. The system is developed within the context of **CS316 – Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**, with a strong emphasis on:

- Research rigor and reproducibility  
- Ethical and responsible use of AI  
- Transparency, interpretability, and non-diagnostic application  
- Societal impact and sustainability

## Problem Statement

> Can an NLP-based machine learning system reliably analyze Arabic textual narratives to classify depression and anxiety severity levels over time, while adhering to ethical constraints and supporting early awareness rather than clinical diagnosis?

---

## Scope

The scope of this project includes:

- Using **synthetic and curated mental-health related Arabic text data**  
- Applying **text embeddings** and classical machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines)  
- Evaluating model performance using standard classification metrics  
- Designing a **longitudinal alert mechanism** based on severity trends  
- Providing a **prototype application** for demonstration and experimentation  
- Analyzing technical, ethical, and practical limitations  

This system is intended as a **supportive screening and monitoring tool**, not a replacement for professional mental health assessment.
