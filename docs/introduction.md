# Introduction

Mental health conditions such as **anxiety** and **depression** are highly prevalent and often under-reported. Many individuals express emotional states and distress through written text (social media posts, journals, surveys, etc.), creating an opportunity for **AI-assisted analysis** that can support awareness and research.

This project investigates whether **NLP-based classifiers** can reliably detect patterns related to anxiety and depression in text. It is developed within the context of **CS316 – Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**, with a strong emphasis on:

- Research rigor (clear problem formulation, experiments, and analysis)
- Responsible and ethical AI
- Societal and sustainability considerations

---

## Problem Statement

> Can we build an NLP-based system that classifies textual entries according to mental-health related indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression vs. non-clinical), while respecting ethical constraints and providing meaningful evaluation?

---

## Scope

- Use real mental-health related text datasets (including Arabic)
- Train, evaluate, and compare Machine Learning models (e.g., SVM classifiers)
- Provide a prototype web application for interactive testing
- Analyze limitations, risks, and potential real-world applications
