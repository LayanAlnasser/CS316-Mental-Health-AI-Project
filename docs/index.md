## Project In One Paragraph

The system uses labeled mental-health datasets (including Arabic text) to train text classification models that distinguish between different mental health states. It evaluates the potential of AI-assisted tools to support **early risk detection, awareness, and research**, while explicitly addressing **ethics, fairness, privacy, and societal impact**.
