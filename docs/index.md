# CS316 Mental Health AI Project

Welcome to the documentation site for the **CS316: Mental Health AI Project**.

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze textual expressions related to mental health, with a focus on **depression** and **anxiety** severity assessment. The project is developed as part of the **CS316 – Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** course (Semester 252) and follows a **research-oriented and responsible AI** approach.

## Project in One Paragraph

This project investigates the use of embedding-based NLP models and classical machine learning classifiers to analyze mental health–related text, including Arabic-language narratives. The system evaluates textual inputs to classify depression and anxiety severity levels and supports **longitudinal monitoring through alert mechanisms**. Emphasis is placed on **ethical AI practices**, including transparency, privacy preservation, fairness, and non-diagnostic use, with the goal of supporting early awareness, research, and responsible experimentation rather than clinical decision-making.
