# Privacy Notice

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Notice explains how information is handled in connection with the research project and website/repository associated with the paper:

> **“AI-Based Longitudinal Tracking for Early Prediction of Mental Health Decline with Predictive Alerts”**
> College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The authors are committed to protecting privacy, respecting data protection principles, and ensuring ethical use of data and technology.

## 2. Nature of the Data Used in This Project

This project uses **synthetic, AI-generated data** designed to simulate longitudinal mental health text data for research and experimental purposes.

* No real patient data is used.
* No real personal data of identifiable individuals is collected, stored, or processed as part of the dataset used in the experiments.
* The synthetic dataset does not correspond to real persons and cannot be used to identify any individual.

Because the dataset is synthetic, the risk of personal data exposure is minimized by design.

## 3. Data Collected Through the Website or Repository

Depending on how this project is hosted (e.g., on a personal website, GitHub Pages, or similar platforms), limited technical information may be collected automatically by the hosting provider, such as:

* IP address
* Browser type and version
* Pages visited and access timestamps

This information, if collected, is used **only for basic website analytics, security, and performance monitoring** by the hosting platform and is not used by the authors to identify users.

The authors do not intentionally collect:

* Names
* Email addresses
* Health information
* Any other personally identifiable information

## 4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

This project itself does not set or manage tracking cookies.
However, the hosting provider or platform (e.g., GitHub, institutional servers, or website hosting services) may use cookies or similar technologies according to their own privacy policies.

Users should refer to the hosting platform’s privacy policy for details about such technologies.

## 5. Use of Information

Any technical or aggregated usage information (if available via the hosting platform) is used solely for:

* Maintaining and improving the website/repository
* Ensuring security and stability
* Understanding general usage patterns (in aggregate form only)

No information is used for profiling, marketing, or commercial purposes.

## 6. Data Sharing

* The authors do not sell, rent, or trade any user data.
* No personal data is shared with third parties by the authors.
* The synthetic dataset and research materials may be shared publicly for academic and research purposes, as described in the paper and repository, but these do not contain real personal data.

## 7. Ethical Use and Research Disclaimer

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes only**.
It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and it should not be used as a substitute for professional mental health care.

All experimental results are based on synthetic data and are presented to demonstrate methodological feasibility and technical performance.

## 8. Data Security

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are taken to protect the project materials and the hosting environment. Since no real personal data is processed, privacy risks are inherently limited.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the project, hosting environment, or legal/ethical requirements. Any updates will be published on the same website or repository.

## 10. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Notice or the handling of data in this project, please contact the authors via the institutional or listed email addresses in the paper.
