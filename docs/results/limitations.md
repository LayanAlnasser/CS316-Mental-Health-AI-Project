# Limitations

Some limitations of the current project include:

- **Dataset Size and Diversity**  
  Datasets may be limited in size or biased toward certain communities.

- **Label Quality**  
  Labels may not be clinically verified; they often come from self-reports or heuristics.

- **Language and Culture**  
  Mental health expressions vary across languages and cultures, especially in **Arabic dialects**.

- **Model Complexity**  
  Current models (e.g., SVM) may not capture nuanced context as well as large transformer models.

- **Non-Clinical Nature**  
  The system is not validated for clinical use and should not be used for diagnosis.

These limitations are discussed further in the [IEEE Paper](../paper/paper.md).
