# Project Requirements

This project follows the **CS316 – Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** course project requirements. Specifically, the project must:

- Implement one or more **AI/ML models** relevant to the chosen problem.
- Use appropriate **evaluation metrics** to measure performance.
- Use **real** or **well-documented** datasets.
- Address **ethical, societal, and sustainability** implications.
- Provide **reproducible experiments** and clear documentation.
- Follow an **IEEE-style** research paper format for the written report.
- Deliver a **source code repository** with a clean structure and instructions.
- Present results through a **presentation** and supporting visuals.

## Deliverables

The final submission must include:

1. **Source Code Repository** (GitHub)
2. **Datasets** or dataset sources (with documentation)
3. **Trained Models** (if applicable)
4. **IEEE-style Research Paper**
5. **Presentation Slides**
6. Optional: **Prototype Application** (e.g., Streamlit, Flask)

## Documentation Expectations

The project documentation must cover:

- Problem definition and motivation
- Dataset description and preprocessing methods
- Model selection and reasoning
- Training and evaluation methodology
- Results and interpretation
- Error analysis
- Ethical and societal considerations
- Future work and limitations

## Evaluation Criteria (High-Level)

The course rubric evaluates:

- **Correctness** and technical depth
- **Research quality** and literature awareness
- **Model performance** and metrics
- **Code organization & reproducibility**
- **Communication clarity**
- **Ethical reflection**
- **Professional writing & formatting**

Refer to the official CS316 specification for detailed scoring categories and weights.
