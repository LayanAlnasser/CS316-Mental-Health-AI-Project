# Ethics, Sustainability, and Societal Considerations

This project follows responsible AI and ethical research practices, especially due to the sensitive nature of mental health applications.

## Privacy and Data Protection
- The dataset used in this project is **AI-generated synthetic Arabic text** that simulates longitudinal mental health statements.
- The data was **not collected from real individuals** or online platforms.
- Therefore, the project avoids risks related to **personal privacy, consent, or handling identifiable sensitive information**.

## Bias and Fairness
To reduce the risk of unfair outcomes:
- Generated samples were reviewed to reduce **linguistic imbalance**.
- The project avoids patterns that could lead to biased predictions or unfair severity labeling.

## Transparency and Responsible Use
This system is designed as a **supportive screening tool**, not a diagnostic tool:
- Predictions are intended to support awareness and early risk detection.
- Outputs should not be treated as medical diagnoses and should not replace clinical judgment.
- Human oversight remains essential for interpreting results responsibly.

## Sustainability and Societal Value
This work supports early awareness and proactive intervention by enabling:
- scalable monitoring based on text entries,
- timely alerting mechanisms,
- and broader accessibility for Arabic-language users.

The broader societal goal is to contribute to community well-being through ethical, transparent, and responsible AI-driven mental health support.
