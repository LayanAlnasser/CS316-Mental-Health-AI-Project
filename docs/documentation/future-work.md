# Future Work

Possible extensions of this project:

- Use **transformer-based models** (e.g., BERT, AraBERT) for deeper context understanding.
- Collect or integrate larger, more diverse mental health datasets.
- Add **explainability** (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention visualization).
- Investigate cross-lingual transfer between English and Arabic.
- Explore temporal patterns in user texts (e.g., progression over time).
- Integrate more fine-grained labels (e.g., different anxiety types, stress, burnout).
