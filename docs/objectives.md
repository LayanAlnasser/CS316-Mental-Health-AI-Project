# Project Objectives

The main objectives of the CS316 Mental Health AI Project are:

1. **Apply AI & NLP Techniques**

   - Use standard preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization/embeddings)

   - Train classification models for mental health-related labels (e.g., anxiety, depression).

2. **Use Real and Relevant Datasets**

   - Work with mental-health data containing labeled text.

   - Include **Arabic** entries where possible to highlight multilingual NLP.

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**

   - Report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

   - Analyze errors and discuss the reliability of predictions.

4. **Incorporate Responsible AI Principles**

   - Address privacy, bias, fairness, and potential harms.

   - Clearly state that the system is **not a diagnostic tool**.

5. **Deliver Research-Style Artifacts**

   - An IEEE-style research paper.

   - A reproducible codebase and documented pipeline.

   - A short presentation and (optional) video summarizing the work.

6. **Identify Future Research Directions**

   - Suggest improvements (e.g., larger datasets, deep learning models, explainability).
   
   - Discuss how such systems could be used responsibly in practice.
