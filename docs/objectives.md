# Project Objectives

<div class="home-hero" markdown>
<div class="home-hero__text" markdown>

## Research Goals and Technical Direction

This project aims to design, evaluate, and document a longitudinal AI framework for depression and anxiety severity assessment in Arabic text.  

The objectives extend beyond simple classification and focus on structured modeling, ethical deployment, and research reproducibility.

## Core Technical Objectives

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-brain: **Develop Dual Severity Models**

    ---
    Train independent Support Vector Machine classifiers for depression and anxiety severity prediction using embedding-based feature representations.

-   :material-translate: **Advance Arabic NLP Research**

    ---
    Apply multilingual embedding models to Arabic text and explore challenges related to underrepresented languages in mental health NLP.

-   :material-timeline: **Enable Longitudinal Monitoring**

    ---
    Move from static cross-sectional classification toward temporal modeling of mental health trajectories using structured alert logic.

---

## Evaluation and Validation

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-chart-bar: **Quantitative Performance Analysis**

    ---
    Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics with stratified data splits.

-   :material-magnify: **Error and Reliability Assessment**

    ---
    Analyze borderline cases and misclassifications to assess model robustness and generalization stability.

## Responsible AI and Ethical Design

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-shield-check: **Ethical Data Usage**

    ---
    Utilize synthetic longitudinal datasets to ensure privacy preservation and minimize sensitive data exposure.

-   :material-scale-balance: **Transparency and Boundaries**

    ---
    Position the system strictly as a research-driven decision-support tool rather than a diagnostic instrument.

-   :material-eye-outline: **Interpretability and Construct Validity**

    ---
    Align linguistic patterns and model behavior with established psychological indicators of depression and anxiety.

## Research Deliverables

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-file-document: **IEEE-Style Research Paper**

    ---
    Document methodology, experiments, results, and alert framework design.

-   :material-code-tags: **Reproducible Experimental Pipeline**

    ---
    Provide structured preprocessing, embedding generation, training, and evaluation workflows.

-   :material-presentation: **Technical Presentation**

    ---
    Summarize findings, contributions, and future directions in a structured academic format.

## Future Research Directions

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-database-plus: **Expanded Datasets**

    ---
    Incorporate real-world longitudinal data and clinical validation.

-   :material-vector-polyline: **Sequential Modeling**

    ---
    Explore temporal deep learning architectures such as LSTM or transformer-based sequence models.

-   :material-brain: **Domain-Specific Embeddings**

    ---
    Refine Arabic mental health embeddings to improve semantic sensitivity.
