# Project Objectives

The main objectives of the CS316 Mental Health AI Project are as follows:

1. **Apply AI and NLP Techniques**
   - Use standard text preprocessing and representation methods, including cleaning and embedding-based vectorization.
   - Train machine learning classification models to analyze mental health–related text and identify indicators of depression and anxiety.

2. **Use Relevant Mental Health Text Data**
   - Work with labeled mental health–related textual data.
   - Include **Arabic-language text** to highlight challenges and opportunities in multilingual and low-resource NLP contexts.
   - Utilize **synthetic and curated datasets** to ensure ethical data usage and privacy preservation.

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**
   - Assess models using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyze classification errors and discuss model reliability and limitations.

4. **Incorporate Responsible AI Principles**
   - Address ethical considerations including privacy, bias, fairness, and transparency.
   - Clearly state that the system is intended as a **supportive screening and research tool**, not a diagnostic or clinical decision system.

5. **Deliver Research-Oriented Artifacts**
   - Produce an IEEE-style research paper documenting the methodology and findings.
   - Provide a reproducible codebase and a well-documented experimental pipeline.
   - Prepare a presentation and supporting materials summarizing the project.

6. **Identify Future Research Directions**
   - Propose potential improvements such as larger datasets, domain-specific embeddings, or sequential and deep learning models.
   - Discuss how AI-based mental health monitoring systems could be deployed responsibly in real-world contexts.
